        <h1><strong>History of Mama's Chocolate Cake</strong></h1>
            <p>
                The original Mama's chocolate cake, which was made with six candy bars, was developed post-World War II. Americans loved the recipe because it celebrated the end of food shortages and, thus, the end of the war years.<br>
                When you hear the phrase "Mama's chocolate cake" these days, you'll likely think of Mama's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake — the recipe found on the back of the brand's unsweetened cocoa powder box.<hr>
            </p>
        <h2><strong>Mama's Chocolate Cake Ingredients</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sugar</strong>
                    <p>Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness, while locking in the moisture from the other ingredients.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flour</strong>
                    <p>All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent, and helps build the fluffy texture.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cocoa Powder</strong>
                    <p> Of course, you'll want to use Mama's brand unsweetened cocoa powder for this one. It adds the rich, indulgent flavor you know and love. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Leaveners</strong>
                    <p>Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners, which means they cause the batter to expand and give the cake a perfect rise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Salt</strong>
                    <p>Just a teaspoon of salt is all you'll need to add complexity and highlight the other flavors. It might not seem like a lot, but you'll definitely miss the salt if you skip it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Eggs</strong>
                    <p>Whole eggs affect the cake in a number of ways: They provide structure, add moisture, lend flavor, and contribute to a tender texture.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Milk</strong>
                    <p>Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together smoothly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Oil</strong>
                    <p> Vegetable oil ensures your cake will never be dry.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vanilla</strong>
                    <p>Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavor and bring out the flavors of the other ingredients, such as the cocoa powder.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Boiling Water</strong>
                    <p>You might be wondering why this recipe calls for a cup of boiling water. It intensifies the chocolatey flavor, contributes to the fluffy texture, and reacts with the leaveners to create an even higher rise.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the Batter</strong>
                        <p>Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bake the Cake</strong>
                        <p>Pour the batter into two prepared cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Frost the Cake</strong>
                        <p>While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.</p>
